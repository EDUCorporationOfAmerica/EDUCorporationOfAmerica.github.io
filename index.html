						<h3> Importance of Subject - Verb agreement </h3>
								
						<p>What is subject/ verb agreement?

Subject verb agreement simply means the subject and verb must agree with each other. This means both need to be singular or both need to be plural.</p>

<p>For example: The sky (look/ looks )beautiful tonight.
Since the subject sky is in singular form, therefore the verb looks should be in singular form as well.</P>

<p>Another example: I am/are a really good cook.
The word I is a singular noun(subject) , therefore we needed a singular verb which is am
But if I said: We are/am really good cooks. The word We is in plural form therefore the verb are should be in singular form as well</p>


<p>Why is this important?

You may sit here and ask yourself: “ Why do I need this? I speak great English.” Well, we are here to continue your “great” English speaking abilities. We believe that subject verb agreement is very important because we have to communicate clearly in the English language. Its very easy to get confused with the English language. Knowing the proper way to place the correct subject and verb tense, you will never have a problem with speaking to your peers and colleagues.   </P>



<p>What you will learn in this lesson?
You will learn how to use the proper subject and verb agreement in a sentence</P

								<p>Hello eager learners. This is Jalen Austin, a class 10 student at Year Up Chicago. Jalen Austin is currently a tech geek in the making. Tech-Nerd Austin was born and raised on the south-side of Chicago. His interests consist of learning information technology, playing basketball or sports in general, and writing music. Jalen's number one goal in life is to become this generations next successful CEO. He desires to set an example for kids who need guidance and show them that anything is achievable through hard work and ambition. "Dedicate yourself to success and nothing will stop you," is one of many mottos Jalen Austin lives by.</p>

 								<p>Year Up has taught him so much over the period of L&D (Learning and Development phase of Year Up). Year Up has changed Jalen Austin's whole perception of life for the better, and has exposed him to the brighter road to success in life. Year up has even inspired Jalen to create his own quote. "No matter who you are and where you come from, success is around the corner, but It is up to you to decide if you're going to turn left at the light or make a right and enjoy life." by Jalen Austin 6/30/2015. His advice to the eager learners who are interested in succeeding in life is to choose friends wisely because a humans personality is influence by the 5 people he/she hangs around and the 20 people he/she receives advice from. Choosing friends is a difficulty that Jalen Austin has faced for a long time, but Year Up Chicago has surrounded him with successful minded friends who care and wants to see him succeed. So he will.</p>

								<p>William Galllion is a Class 10 Student at Year Up Chicago. William was born and raised on the Near-North and West sides of Chicago, Illinois. He currently resides in Maywood, Illinois. William’s interests include: learning IT, playing sports, listening to music and hanging with friends and family. William’s goals include: becoming a CEO to a fortune 500 company, providing opportunities to those in need and ultimately, becoming a sports analyst for ESPN. William lives by the quote “Rise Above Hate” because he believes that there will always be doubters doubting a person’s potential, so it’s up to the person to prove his or her doubter wrong.</p>

								<p>During his time at Year Up, William has shown himself to be very resilient, hardworking and supportive of his fellow colleagues. William has demonstrated what it means to be a leader by helping his fellow colleagues keep track of their assignments, stepping up to challenging tasks and ultimately being a voice. His Year Up experience has also taught him to persevere through any obstacle. During module II of Learning and Development, William unfortunately fell below one hundred points, but he stayed afloat and due to hard work, sacrifice and support from his learning community. Two things William has taken away from his Year Up experience is to always “expect the unexpected” and to “never be afraid to take a chance”.</p>
